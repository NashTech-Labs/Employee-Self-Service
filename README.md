Building Reactive Play application with Anorm SQL data access

This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:
- Accessing a JDBC database, using Anorm.  
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).  Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.
