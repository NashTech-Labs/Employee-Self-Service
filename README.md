[Employee-Self-Service](http://play-with-anorm.herokuapp.com/)
==================================================================
Building Reactive Play application with Anorm SQL data access

This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:
- Accessing a JDBC database, using Anorm.  
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1).  Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.
